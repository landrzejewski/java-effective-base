    switch as an expression

      error.
    - For a switch on a non-enum / non-sealed selector you need a default to make the switch total.
    - This composes well with var: var label = switch (x) { ... };.

    Exhaustiveness on enums

    When the selector is an enum and every constant is covered by an arrow case, no default is required and the
    compiler enforces total coverage.

    The big payoff is forward compatibility: adding a new constant to the enum turns every existing exhaustive
    switch into a compile error, forcing the author to acknowledge the new case. Compare to a switch with default —
    the default silently absorbs the new constant and you may ship a bug.

    Sealed types (Mod010) get the same compiler-enforced exhaustiveness.
